					<p class="mt-6 md:mt-6 md:pr-4 text-lg font-semibold">The former Unilever brand manager re-writes the week’s headlines on the long-running Radio 4 favourite The Now Show, and on Mock the Week.</p>									
					<p class="mt-6">Hugh Dennis made his name as one half of Punt & Dennis. He and Steve Punt still appear together on Radio 4’s The Now Show, whilst Hugh also captains his team on Mock The Week, and starred in Outnumbered - the wonderfully inventive semi-improvised BBC sitcom.</p>
					<p class="mt-6">After originally working as a brand manager for Unilever, Hugh turned a talent for impressions to better use and began to provide voices for Spitting Image. He then became a regular guest on the Jasper Carott Show and joined the team on the seminal standup and sketch show The Mary Whitehouse Experience, which first aired on the radio before becoming a cult BBC2 hit.</p>
					<p class="mt-6">Hugh and Steve starred in several peak time series of their own, including The Imaginatively Titled Punt & Dennis Show - and Me, You and Him. Hugh has been a guest on panel shows from QI to Would I Lie to You? and has gone on to a host of both comic and serious acting roles from New Tricks to Agatha Christie’s Marple, Not Going Out to Doctors, Midsomer Murders to the acclaimed Fleabag.</p>
