title: SUSTAINABLE COMPANY OF THE YEAR AWARD
description: This category is designed to recognise organisations that push the boundaries in an effort to create an environmentally friendly and affordable solution to an existing potentially polluting product. The judges will give credit for evidence of positive, value adding results that make innovative use of otherwise wasted resources, through; for example, the use of a previously regarded waste product into a new useful product. Initiatives will also be rewarded for addressing energy, water and general ecological footprinting as well as wider concerns around food and waste.
