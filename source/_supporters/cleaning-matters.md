Now in its 20th year Cleaning Matters continues to be the UK’s largest and only audited
magazine within the cleaning industry. Cleaning Matters presents the latest innovations
and insight that can aid the task of cleaning, maintenance and hygiene, as well as
delivering independent news, views and developments from within the market.

Regular contributions from leading industry experts combined with Cleaning Matters’ knowledge of the marketplace
and accessible style make it a must-read as well as an indispensable reference tool.

As the market evolves, Cleaning Matters – as the industry’s market-leading publication – moves with it. We know how
busy those working in the cleaning and maintenance industry are, and to meet the needs of our readers, the
magazine is divided into nine regular sections that will make sourcing product and service solutions simple and easy
to digest.

This comprehensive publication also aligns itself with influential voices and key industry stakeholders. Columns from
The Worldwide Cleaning Industry Association (ISSA) and the British Institute of Cleaning Science (BICSc) are featured,
alongside contributions from a host of respected cleaning experts, to provide exclusive advice and opinions on current issues in the industry.
