BPCA is the professional association for the UK public health pest management industry.

We're a not-for-profit organisation acting in the interests of our members and on behalf of the pest management industry in the UK.

**What is BPCA's role?**
The provision of pest management and control services is an area which is often overlooked, however inadequate pest control can often have catastrophic effects economically, socially and on the public's health. BPCA promotes the highest standards of professionalism within the industry, allowing only organisations that prove their competence to join as members.

It's our role to:

- Highlight the risks of inadequate control
- Offer guidance in what to look for when searching for a pest control contractor
- Provide general pest advice and guidance documentation
- Provide advice on how to select an appropriate pest control professional
